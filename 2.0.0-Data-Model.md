### Data Model
Currently, the data model is built around two main models, the Tool and the ToolVersion. A Tool describes one pairing of a tool and one Docker image. A ToolVersion describes a particular iteration of a tool as fixed by a reference to a specific image id, a Dockerfile (which was used to build an image) as fixed by a URL, and a descriptor for the tool in either CWL or WDL.

#### Design Decisions

We are starting with a read-only API due to potentially different views and approaches to registration/security.

Multiple formats for descriptors such as [CWL](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language) and [WDL](https://github.com/broadinstitute/wdl) are permitted. 

Tools should have a globally unique identifier which identifies the authoritative source for a tool (ex: 123456323@agora.broadinstitute.org )

The entire schema is shown below, but a more useful form is the Swagger editor to view our [schema in progress](http://editor.swagger.io/#/?import=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-schemas/develop/src/main/resources/swagger/ga4gh-tool-discovery.yaml) 

Note that the swagger editor itself can kickstart a project by generating servers and clients in a variety of languages.

#### Outstanding Questions

##### Authentication and Authorization 

GA4GH recommends the use of the OAuth 2.0 framework (RFC 6749) for authentication and authorization. It is also recommended that implementations of this standard implement and follow the GA4GH Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) standard.

While the TRS standard itself does not define any behaviour specific to authorization, given that it hosts and shares publicly available workflows. For future expansion, we recommend that if authorization is needed, that it follows the OAuth 2.0 recommendations as defined above.

##### Other

* How do we track authorship? Should we track authorship of the tool metadata, the Docker image, or the underlying algorithm, or all of above?
* What do we need to provide to allow for indexing and external services like an external sparql service.
* Versioning
* Terminology discussion (do we describe triples separately from tools? should we describe them as aggregations of tools for just the case that CWL documents have more than one tool? etc.)
